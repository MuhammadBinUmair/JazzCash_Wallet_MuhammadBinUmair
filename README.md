# JazzCash_Wallet_MuhammadBinUmair
**What is the code about?**

This is a console-based JazzCash Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
The program allows a user to create a JazzCash account, log in using a PIN, check balance, send money to another 11-digit phone number, perform mobile recharge, and view account details.
User data such as name, phone number, PIN, and balance is stored permanently using file handling, so the data is retained even after the program is closed.

**How to compile and run it?**

Open a C++ compiler on Windows such as Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio.
Create a new C++ project.
Copy the full source code into a .cpp file.
Make sure the compiler supports standard C++ libraries like <iostream>, <fstream>, and <string>.
Compile the program.
Run the executable file.
If no account file is found, the program will ask you to create a new account.
Log in using the PIN to access the JazzCash menu and use the available options.
